# alu-Sparse-Matrix
Alu-DSA-HW01_Sparse-Matrix
This Python program defines a Sparse Matrix structure and its related operations. It enables loading matrices from files, performing basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and displaying the results. The core of the program is the SparseMatrix class, which stores non-zero elements using a dictionary.

Key methods include:

_load_matrix_from_file(filepath)
import_from_file(file_path) â€” used to read matrix dimensions and parse matrix elements.
update_value(self, row, col, val) and retrieve_value(self, row, col).
